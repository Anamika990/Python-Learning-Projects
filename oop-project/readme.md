#  Python OOP & Data Visualization Project

This project combines **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles with **data analysis and visualization** techniques using Python.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Implement Python classes using core OOP principles such as **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**.
- Process and clean data from a `.dat` file, convert it to `.csv`, and handle exceptions gracefully.
- Create insightful visualizations to identify trends and patterns in the data.


##  OOP Implementation

- Designed a **superclass**, multiple **subclasses**, and **sub-subclasses** to simulate a real-world scenario.
- Applied the following OOP concepts:
  - **Inheritance** – Share functionality across a class hierarchy.
  - **Encapsulation** – Protect class attributes and methods.
  - **Polymorphism** – Override methods to allow flexible behavior.


##  Data Processing

- Read from a `.dat` file and exported the cleaned data to a `.csv` file.
- Handled:
  - Missing/null values
  - Data formatting
  - Exceptions during file I/O and data conversion


##  Visualizations Included

Using libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, the following chart types were created:

1. **Bar Charts – Compare categorical or numerical data.**
2. **Boxplots – Display distribution and outliers.**
3. **Line Plots – Show trends over time.**
4. **Scatter Plots – Identify relationships between variables.**
5. **Histograms – Analyze data distribution.**
6. **Pie Charts – Illustrate parts of a whole.**
7. **Heat Maps – Visualize correlation matrices or density.**

Each visualization is used to support storytelling and help readers/audience understand key trends in the dataset.
