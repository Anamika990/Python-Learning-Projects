    "__In this course we will study four data structures in Python: `lists`, `tuples`, `sets`, and `dictionaries`. They are called sequences because they hold sequences of elements. These data structures are also called `iterables`, because one can loop through them one value at a time.  Generally speaking, `iterables` are anything that can be looped over (i.e. you can loop over a string or file).  We also use the term `containers` to refer to them.__\n"
